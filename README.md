Works with Web view. 

Tried to open the app on Android with Expo Go, but keeps pushing the error "Text strings must be rendered within a <Text> component". Tried out various fixes people posted regarding the format comments are written inside the code, no results. Could simply be caused by a single unnoticed letter or semicolon.
